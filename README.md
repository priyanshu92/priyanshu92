### Hi!ðŸ‘‹

- I am working as a Software Engineer II :computer: with Microsoft.

## Skillset
Although, I have worked with many different languages, my primary tool of choice is .NET with C# for server side apps. I use React to write frontend apps and working to add [Blazor](https://blazor.net) to the mix as well.
